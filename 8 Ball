# Create a magic 8 Ball program.
#                                         Objectives
# Create a tool that will take a question as an input and do the following:
# Wait 5 seconds
# Give updates to user
# Implement wait of .5 second between 10  .'s
# Wait 1 second
# Use series of if elif statements to get an output.
# 9 different responses.
# Setup

import random
import time

number = random.randint (1, 9)

# User Question
input("Ask the magic 8 ball a question: ")
time.sleep(5)                                          # Wait

# Updates to user
print("Searching for an answer.")
print("Please be patient.")
